//DOM -> DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL----------------------------------
IT IS SOMETHING THAT THE BROWSER CREATES WHICH HELPS US IN CHANGING THE HTML AND CSS OF A WEBPAGE.
 
Each web browser has it's own java script engine -> chrome has v8 engine, explorer/edge has chakra core, safari has 
nitros, firefox has spider monkey, they are the ones that look at the java script file and read it line by line and 
execute the javascript file. 
Document is an object(but web browsers hide the fact that it is an object and gives us a nice html code view so we can 
play around with it easily), which we see on the browser(the webpage), it has a parent object called WINDOW -> it 
describes the browser, it is the parent of everyhting in a browser. 

A Web browser has a Window Object, that has a property document, which specifies what should get displayed. 
Now, to decide what to get displayed the document object, the DOM reads the html and css and then the javascript that 
is read line by line by a java script engine reads through it and then if it ever needs to change anything, the 
java script can speak with the document object and modify html and css.
