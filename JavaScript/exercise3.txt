// Make a Calculator! using prompt(), and variables, make a program that does the following:
// 1. Prompts the user for first number.
// 2. Stores that first number
// 3. Prompts the user for the second number.
// 4. stores that number and responds with the SUM by using an alert.  


// BONUS: Make a program that can subtract, multiply, and also divide!

var f = prompt("Please enter the First Number: ");
var s = prompt("Please Enter the Second Number: ");
var sum = Number(f)+Number(s);
var subtract = f-s;
var multi = f*s;
var divide = f/s;
alert("The sum is: "+sum);
alert("The difference is: "+subtract);
alert("The multiplication is: "+multi);
alert("The division is: "+divide);
